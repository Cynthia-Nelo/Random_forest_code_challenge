# Random Forest Model for World Population Data
This script provides a brief guide to testing your knowledge on how to create an ensemble model, specifically a Random Forest Regressor. We'll use world population data to train the model, applying various tools in Python such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Code Overview
Data Preparation: Load the world population data into a pandas DataFrame.
Model Building: Create and train a Random Forest model using RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.
Cross-validation: Use KFold to perform cross-validation and evaluate the model.
Model Evaluation: Calculate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error from sklearn.metrics.

## Conclusion
This script demonstrates how to build a Random Forest Regressor to predict world population trends based on historical data. The cross-validation ensures the model's robustness and provides a metric for its performance.
